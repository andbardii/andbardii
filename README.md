# About Me
My name is Andrea and I am a 20 years old boy, graduate with excellent marks in Graphics and Communication, now I have finished a high training course as a Full Stack Developer at Epicode.

I have always wanted to work in digital and I based my studies on this belief. In the coming years, however, I want to continue to train and research new technologies with which to test myself. 

I'm looking for a junior position as front or back developer to apply and improve my skills.s, I will continue to train and look for new technologies to test myself.
