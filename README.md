<h1>👨‍💻 About Me</h1>

📌 With <b>[FAM Vision](https://famvision.it/)</b> I deal with website and web app development, branding and rebranding, social management and much more, in short, if you need a new digital identity, optimized and unique, whether for you or for your company, you are in the right place!

🙋🏻‍♂️ My name is Andrea and I am a 22 years old graduate in Graphics and Communication, I later decided to take a course of high training as a Full Stack Developer and now I'm following the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering & Artificial Intelligence at Epicode.

💻 I have always wanted to work in digital and I based my training on this belief. In the coming years I want to continue to train and research new technologies with which to test myself, aware of the challenge undertaken by choosing to become a developer.

🗣️ I have so many passions like technology, innovation, creative design, travel and finance.

🦾 The soft skills I can count on are a collaborative personality, a great spirit of adaptation and the certainty of being 100% involved in what I do.
