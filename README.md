<h1>👨‍💻 About Me</h1>

🙋🏻‍♂️ My name is Andrea and I am a 21 years old boy graduate in Graphics and Communication, I have finished a high training course as a Full Stack Developer at Epicode and I have recently joined the developer team at CADENAS Italiana as a Junior Developer.

💻 I have always wanted to work in digital and I based my training on this belief. In the coming years I want to continue to train and research new technologies with which to test myself, aware of the challenge undertaken by choosing to become a programmer.

🗣️ I have so many passions like technology, innovation, creative design, travel or finance, looking for a place to share my interests I found in LinkedIn the ideal platform and for a year now I publish short content of all kinds here on my profile.

🦾 The soft skills I can count on are a collaborative personality, a great spirit of adaptation and the certainty of being 100% involved in what I do.
